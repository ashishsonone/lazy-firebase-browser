On hover, provide following options:
(x) refresh node option
(x) delete node option
(x) open in firebase option

(x) Firebase auth:(using 'crypto-js' : both node-js & browser)
    - Store 'encrypted' admin access token in angular script, one for each of your firebase databases
    - Require a secret to be passed in url query to decrypt it into actual token
    - This decrypted auth token will then be used in all REST api calls to firebase
    - If no secret provided or accessing some other firebase database, simple api calls will be made without an auth token
    
(x) At user's own risk, deep loading of node i.e with all data
( ) Clean(simplify) & Optimize the angular code - find out why slower than firebase's ui?
( ) Long list pagination
